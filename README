lowpower - minimise system power usage

intented to be run once before a long stint on battery power

This is a knife, and it cuts these things:
  - stops and disables (several) services
  - agressively powersaves harddisks
  - remounts everything noatime
  - sets magic sysctls to reduce swapping and dirty writeouts
  - switches wlan0, eth1 (wifi) and eth0 (lan)to lowpower
  - disables extraneous video card outputs
  - loads one cpu core to avoid waking the other
  - sets the brightness to lowest
  - mounts /var/log on tmpfs
  - forces discharge of large battery first
  - intel HDA powersaving
  - SATA link-level powermanagement
  - kills xcompmgr.

This knife does NOT:
 - do any autosensing / error handling. We blindly employ every single 
 technique we know of to reduce power, and we care naught if you don't have
 that particular device.
 - go radio silent. unless you uncomment that stuff.
 - set usb autosuspend
 - disable blinking cursors and other powerhog bling
 - check pidstat -d 10 to see what's waking up your harddisk, and kill the
 process or mount the location readonly
 - play your music and videos from tmpfs
 - tell you how much you save. Try the references below for that.

 kwy recommends *always* measure power usage to detect patterns.

Bug reports and new ways to reduce power consumptions are welcome!
